> **This R package significantly simplifies the DCO process in clinical trials by replacing complex, error-prone SAS macros with a clean, configurable, and extensible workflow in R.**

## Overview

Clinical trials rely heavily on timely and precise Data Cut-Off (DCO) processes to ensure both participant safety and the validity of trial outcomes. The DCO marks the date after which no new data are considered for a specific analysis. It is a critical component in the ongoing evaluation of safety profiles and efficacy, particularly during interim analyses or final reporting.

Traditionally, the DCO process has been implemented using SAS macros, which, while robust, can be time-consuming to debug and rigid to customize. With the rise of open-source tools in the clinical domain, R has become an increasingly attractive alternative for clinical programmers.

This project introduces an R package designed specifically to manage the DCO process in compliance with industry standards. The tool streamlines the filtering and transformation of clinical datasets based on a specified DCO date using a user-friendly, YAML-configurable interface.

## Key Features

- **YAML-driven configuration**: Define datasets, date variables, and transformation rules without modifying the code.
- **Predefined DCO methods**: Apply common DCO transformations out-of-the-box.
- **Custom method support**: Integrate your own filtering logic when needed.
- **Flexible architecture**: Easily extend or adapt to new data standards or formats.
- **Time-saving automation**: Eliminate the need for manual filtering scripts or debugging SAS macros.

## Installation

Make sure required packages are installed:

```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "lubridate", "rlang", "yaml"))
```
Then, if you have access to the local package:
```r
library(dco)
```
# How to Use
## Step 1: Create a Configuration Template
Run the following function to generate a YAML configuration file in your working directory:
```r
create_config_file()
```
This file allows you to specify:

- The datasets to process

- Date variables and DCO methods

- Input and output paths

- The DCO date

Actual representation of it looks like this:

```yaml
# -----------------------
# General configuration
# -----------------------
general_info:
  input_path: "path/to/your/raw_data"      # <-- Set the input folder path
  output_path: "path/to/your/output_data"  # <-- Set the output folder path
  dco_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"                   # <-- Enter your cut-off date here
  out_file_suffix: "_filt.rds"             # <-- Suffix to append to filtered datasets

# -----------------------
# Rules for each dataset
# -----------------------
dco_rules:
  dataset_name:                            # <-- Set the dataset name that needs DCO process
    - method: method_name                  # <-- Set the method name 
      var: [variables_affected]            # <-- Set variable names that need to be cutted


# -----------------------
# Date variable mapping
# -----------------------
dat_variable_list:
  dataset_name:                            # <-- Set the dataset name that needs DCO process
    - variable name                        # <-- Set date variable names
 yaml: content
```

## Step 2: Perform the DCO Process
Once your config.yaml file is completed with the appropriate parameters, execute:

```r
perform_dco("path/to/your/config.yaml")
```
The specified datasets will be filtered according to the defined logic, and saved to the output path with modified variables as needed.

# Sample example
To demonstrate the overall workflow of the DCO process, a test script and example datasets are provided. These can be found in the file dco/tests/testthat/run_demo.R. Running this script will showcase how the datasets located in the raw_data directory are processed and filtered according to the DCO logic defined in the package.
